# GymnassiumBlogpost
Platform for uploading short stories.

This platform exists for the purpose of allowing children at my school to publish their stories on the internet. I think GymnassiumBlogpost will provide them with the opportunity to share their stories with the rest of the world and have their voices heard. The project is completely non-commercial.

I am using Angular 12 as the frontend framework and for the backend I am using .NET 5. The data is persisted in a Postgres DB.
